# FS19_realManualTransmission
Manual Transmission/Gearbox for FS19


First things first, this is obviously beta. I try not to publish anything gamebraking but don't hate me when your game crashes. :)

# What is this?
This is a manual Gearbox/Transmission mod for FS19. It is not a conversion of GearboxAddon, its an entirely new mod. It has less features than GearboxAddon, its also (for now) just for simulating manual transmissions, not for automatics or CVTs. It also lacks a lot of the physics improvements Gearbox Addon had.
This is basically Giants Physics with the addition of Gears. I don't know physics or scripting enough to create anything more than that, also it seems that FS19 is even more restricted as to what you can actually change or influence.
Doesn't mean this Mod isn't still a lot of fun.. :)


# How do I play this? 
Just download the FS19_realManualTransmission.zip into your modfolder. All the bindings are not mapped by default so you have to go into the Key Bindings first and map all the bindings the way you like them. The key bindings related to this Mod all have the prefix RMT.
I suggest you get the sample-mods from this repository as well to try out gearbox. Those are basegame vehicles that I have added Transmission Configs and edited the sound of, so they have an actual load-sound.
But RMT also adds transmission configs to some of the basegame vehicles. (As of right now, Fiat 1300dt, Valtra A Series and John Deere 6M)
In order to use the transmission with a vehicle it has to have a transmission config.


# How do I add a transmission Config to a Mod?
Start by looking at the sample mods and the basegameConfigs.xml. The transmission config starts with <realManualTransmission> and ends with </realManualTransmission>
